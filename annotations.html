  <li>Contact us (on the header)- Can view different contact information upon clicking the button.</li>

<li>Suscribe (via email) (on the header) - communicates with the database to insert and view information.</li>

<li>Security Analysis:
  <ul>

     <li>For a secure code and functional website, i have checked inputs by users.
User input on various parts of the website is being checked for their validity.</li>
  
   <li>There is some information leakage i.e email adress of the followers. But this issue
can be resolved using log-in methods via unique username and password.</li>

  <li>There could also be Man-in-the-middle attack whoch can be resolved using 
HTTPS.</li>

  <li>Use of htmlspecialchars which returns an HTML-escaped version of a string.</li>

  <li>USe of quote which returns a SQL-escaped version of a string.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
