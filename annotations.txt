3.Security Analysis
	a.  For a secure code and functional website, i have checked inputs by users.
User input on various parts of the website is being checked for their validity.
	
	b. There is some information leakage i.e email adress of the followers. But this issue
can be resolved using log-in methods via unique username and password.

	c.There could also be Man-in-the-middle attack whoch can be resolved using 
HTTPS.

	d.Use of htmlspecialchars which returns an HTML-escaped version of a string.

	e. USe of quote which returns a SQL-escaped version of a string.

Thank you,
